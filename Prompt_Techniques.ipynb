By implementing stricter laws and regulations, individuals and companies will be held accountable for their plastic usage and disposal. This would also create a ripple effect, as it would raise awareness and encourage people to reduce their plastic consumption. The confidence level is also medium to high, as many countries have already implemented similar measures with positive results.

With proper investment and promotion, biodegradable materials can become more accessible and widely used, reducing the demand for plastic products. The confidence level is also medium to high, as there are already successful examples of biodegradable materials being used in various industries.
